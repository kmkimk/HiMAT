# High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT) Science Traceability Matrix

## NASA Earth System Science:

To develop a scientific understanding of Earth's system and its response to natural or human-induced changes, and to improve prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards.

## NASA High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT):

### Objective #1:

To determine the physical processes driving changes in water resources in the HMA region.

### Objective #2: 

To predict impacts of changing HMA water resources on human and biogeophysical systems.  



| Science Objectives | Approach | Data Needed  | Data/output generated | Expected Outcomes |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|


| To quantify the mass variations of the entire HMA region with a focus on isolating mass changes due to hydrology and cryosphere. |	Forward modeling of GRACE Level 1B data together with all available observed/modeled hydrological information.	|Best estimates of cryosphere and hydrology variations in the region along with associated uncertainties, up to daily resolution, up to 1 km spatial.	| Residuals of mass not currently captured by existing cryosphere/hydrology observations and models @ 1x1 degree mascon spatial and monthly temporal resolution across entire HMA.	| Information on deficiencies in existing models /datasets; Formal mechanism for using GRACE to validate model output; iterative procedure can be implemented. |

| To assess the status of glacier mass balance in the HMA region.	| Generation of high resolution DEMs from DigitalGlobe archive using the Ames Stereo Pipeline.	| DigitalGlobe data	4 / 8 / 12 m resolution DEM difference maps, etc | |

| To assess the role of groundwater variations (natural and anthropogenic) in affecting total HMA mass variations. |	Sashaâ€™s modeling	| Well data | | |
